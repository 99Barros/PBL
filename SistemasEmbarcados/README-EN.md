# IoT Monitoring Data Logger Project


This project develops an IoT monitoring system for a Data Logger device, using the ESP32 Doit DEVKIT V1 microcontroller and the FIWARE Descomplicado platform. The goal is to control and monitor environmental variables, such as temperature, luminosity, and humidity, within specific ranges. When the levels of these variables reach predefined limits, the system triggers a visual notification with an LED.



# Project Description

This system is designed to monitor the temperature, humidity, and luminosity of the environment. Using the ESP32, DHT11 sensors, and LDR, the system collects environmental data and sends it to the FIWARE back-end, where it is stored in a MongoDB database through the STH-Comet component. A Python-based dashboard enables real-time monitoring, and notifications are generated on the front-end when the parameters reach the established levels.

# Technical Specifications

* Microcontroller: ESP32 Doit DEVKIT V1

* Back-end: FIWARE Descomplicado Platform

* Storage: MongoDB (via STH-Comet)

*Time Control: Timestamp generated by Orion Context Broker

* User Interface: Dashboard in Python

* Sensors: 

   - DHT11: Temperature and Humidity Sensor

   - LDR: Light Intensity Sensor

* Alert Triggers:


   - Temperature: 15 < t < 25 ºC

   - Luminosity: 0 < l < 30%

   - Humidity: 30% < u < 50%

* Visual Signaling: Blue LED on the ESP32 is triggered when the alert levels are reached.


# System Architecture

This IoT monitoring system is composed of the following components:

* ESP32: Microcontroller that manages data collection and triggers the alert LED.

* FIWARE Descomplicado: Back-end platform to manage and store real-time data.

* Orion Context Broker: Responsible for generating timestamps and maintaining the context of the data.

* STH-Comet: Storage subsystem in MongoDB for storing and retrieving time-series data from the sensors.

* Python Dashboard: Graphical interface for visualizing and monitoring the collected data in real-time.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites:

* Python 3.x (for the dashboard)

* MongoDB

* FIWARE Orion Context Broker and STH-Comet

### ESP32 Configuration:

* Upload the code to the ESP32, configuring the DHT11 and LDR sensors to capture temperature, humidity, and luminosity data.

* Connect the ESP32 to the Wi-Fi network for communication with the FIWARE back-end.

* Define the trigger ranges in the ESP32 code according to the desired limits:

 - Temperature: 15 < t < 25 ºC

 - Luminosity: 0 < l < 30%

 - Humidity: 30% < u < 50%




### FIWARE and MongoDB Configuration

* Start the Orion Context Broker for context management and timestamp generation.

* Configure the STH-Comet to connect to MongoDB and store the collected data.

* In MongoDB, create a database and a collection to store the time-series data.
